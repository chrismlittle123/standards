## 1. Overview

**Why this exists**

- AI coding tools are now good enough that:
    - The **coding step** is being automated rapidly.
    - The real leverage is in **requirements, architecture, testing, and observability**.
- This page describes:
    - How we want to **use agents**.
    - How we **keep quality high** as output scales.
    - The **tools, patterns, and rituals** we’re converging on as a team.

**Who this is for**

- Everyone writing or reviewing code (human or agent-assisted).
- People designing systems and processes around AI coding.
- New joiners who need to understand “how we build things here.”

---

## 2. Core Principles

- **Agents are smart, but not wise**
    
    Use them for speed and breadth; humans remain accountable for “are we doing the right thing?”
    
- **Testability over cleverness**
    
    Small, modular, well-tested components beat giant “omega” classes and spaghetti.
    
- **Requirements first, code second**
    
    The biggest failure mode is building the wrong thing very quickly.
    
- **As little scaffolding as possible**
    
    Prefer simple, powerful agents plus good prompts and standards over heavy, brittle multi-agent frameworks.
    
- **Security is non‑negotiable**
    
    Assume anything readable on your machine might leave your machine.

## 3. Delivery Loop (Where AI Fits)

We treat delivery as a loop:

1. **Understand & frame the problem**
    - Talk to users / stakeholders.
    - Write down clear requirements & constraints.
2. **Design & architecture**
    - High-level design.
    - ADRs + diagrams.
3. **Implement**
    - Human + agents.
    - Follow standards & templates.
4. **Test & validate**
    - Automated tests, coverage, negative paths.
    - Manual exploratory checks where needed.
5. **Deploy & observe**
    - Monitoring, logs, alerts.
    - Feedback from real usage.
6. **Iterate**
    - Refine based on data, not vibes.

> 🔑 Key idea: Step 3 (coding) is getting “free” thanks to AI.
> 
> 
> The compounding value is in steps 1, 2, 4, and 5.

## 4. Quality Tiers (How “Serious” Is This Project?)

Use these tiers to decide how many guardrails we turn on.

### 4.1 Tier 1 – Prototype / Spike

- **Goal:** Fast learning, demos, throwaway exploration.
- **Expectations:**
    - Works on my machine is good enough.
    - Zero tests acceptable.
    - Formatting and linting optional.
    - No long-term support guaranteed.
- **Allowed shortcuts:**
    - Ad-hoc architecture.
    - Low/no coverage.
    - Minimal docs.

### 4.2 Tier 2 – Internal Tool / Non-critical

- **Goal:** Long-lived internal value, moderate risk.
- **Expectations:**
    - ✅ Linting & formatting enforced via **Check My Code (CMC)**.
    - ✅ Basic modular architecture (DI where it matters).
    - ✅ Unit tests for core logic; some integration tests.
    - ✅ Basic regression suite covering main workflows.
    - ✅ Manual testing of key workflows before releases.
    - ✅ CodeCov check with agreed minimum coverage.
    - ✅ Basic monitoring/logging.
    - ✅ Short ADRs for major design decisions.

### 4.3 Tier 3 – Production / External / Sensitive

- **Goal:** User-facing, reputation & revenue at stake.
- **Expectations:**
    - ✅ Strict standards via **CMC** Production Tier rule set.
    - ✅ Solid modular architecture (Clean architecture, dependency injection at top level).
    - ✅ Unit + integration + functional + negative-path tests.
    - ✅ Comprehensive regression suite with automated CI runs.
    - ✅ Mandatory manual testing checklist and exploratory testing sessions.
    - ✅ Coverage targets defined & enforced (CodeCov) - 80% coverage target.
    - ✅ Observability (metrics, logs, dashboards, alerts).
    - ✅ Security review, least-privilege keys, no secrets in repo.
    - ✅ ADRs + up-to-date diagrams.
    - ✅ Small, atomic PRs only; AI code reviewed like human code.

## 5. Architecture & Code-Structure Guidelines

### 5.1 Design for testability

- Prefer many **small, focused units** over large god-classes.
- If coverage can’t get past ~20% even after many tests → architecture smell.
- Keep components and services **loosely coupled** so they can be tested in isolation.

### 5.2 Dependency Injection (DI)

- Inject dependencies at the **top level** of the app.
- Modules should depend on **interfaces/types**, not concrete implementations.
- Example patterns:
    - Pass in `jsonParser` instead of importing from a specific path.
    - Pass in `httpClient`, `dbClient`, etc., from a central composition root.
- Benefits:
    - Easier mocking.
    - Less brittle imports.
    - Clearer mental model of the system’s wiring.

### 5.3 Clean Architecture / Layering

- Separate:
    - **Use cases / flows** (or “application layer”).
    - **Domain models**.
    - **Infrastructure / adapters** (DB, APIs, file systems).
- Rules of thumb:
    - Use cases can import domain & infrastructure.
    - Domain should **not** depend on infrastructure.
    - Infrastructure should not import use cases.
- Consider **type-only modules** to share types without pulling in full implementations.

### 5.4 Branching & PR Strategy

- One branch = **one atomic purpose**.
- Branches should be **mergeable in any order** whenever possible.
- If your feature requires foundational changes:
    - Split “foundations” into its own branch.
    - Feature branch builds on that.
- Aim for small PRs:
    - Easier human + AI review.
    - Fewer surprises during merge.

### 5.5 ADRs & Diagrams

- For non-trivial decisions, write an **ADR (Architectural Decision Record)**:
    - Very short.
    - Bullet style, e.g.:
        - Context (1–2 bullets).
        - Decision (1–2 bullets).
        - Consequences (1–2 bullets).
- Keep ADR bullets:
    - < 8 words per bullet.
    - ~5 bullets total.
- For flows and complex interactions, add a **Mermaid diagram**.

## 6. Testing & Coverage

### 6.1 Principles

- Tests are our main defence against “looks right but is wrong”.
- Coverage % is a **heuristic**, not the goal.
    - High coverage on badly designed tests is still bad.

### 6.2 Guidelines

- **Unit tests** for core business logic and critical utility functions.
- **Integration tests** for interactions between modules and external systems.
- **Negative-path tests** to ensure systems fail safely/gracefully.
- Use **CodeCov** (or equivalent) in CI:
    - Tier 1: optional / loose target.
    - Tier 2: agreed minimum on key modules.
    - Tier 3: stricter targets and enforced gates.

### 6.3 AI & tests

- Agents can:
    - Write test skeletons.
    - Propose scenarios.
    - Update tests when code changes.
- Humans must:
    - Check that tests are meaningful, not just green.
    - Add edge cases the agent wouldn’t think of.

### 6.4 Regression & Manual Testing

- **Regression testing**
    - Ensures that new changes haven't broken existing functionality.
    - Build a regression suite that covers:
        - Critical user journeys (happy paths).
        - Previously fixed bugs (to prevent reintroduction).
        - Integration points between major components.
    - Run regression suites:
        - Before major releases.
        - After dependency updates or framework upgrades.
        - When refactoring core modules.
    - Tier expectations:
        - **Tier 1:** No regression suite needed.
        - **Tier 2:** Basic regression suite covering main workflows.
        - **Tier 3:** Comprehensive regression suite with automated runs in CI.
- **Manual testing**
    - Automated tests can't catch everything (UX issues, visual bugs, unexpected interactions).
    - Guidelines:
        - **Tier 1:** Manual smoke test if you remember; not required.
        - **Tier 2:** Manual testing of key workflows before releases; brief exploratory testing.
        - **Tier 3:** Mandatory manual testing checklist; scheduled exploratory testing sessions; user acceptance testing (UAT) where applicable.
    - Use manual testing for:
        - Exploratory testing (poking around to find unexpected issues).
        - Visual regression (does it look right?).
        - Complex user flows that are hard to automate.
        - Edge cases in UI/UX that automated tests miss.
    - Document manual test scenarios:
        - Keep a simple checklist in Notion or your project repo.
        - Update it when new features are added or bugs are found.

## 7. Tools & Setup

### 7.1 Check My Code (CMC)

> 🛠 Purpose: enforce org-wide coding standards via a single config + CLI.
> 
- NPM package: **`check-my-code`** (CMC).
- Central `cmc.toml` config holds:
    - Linting rules (e.g. Python, TypeScript).
    - Formatting rules.
    - Type-safety rules.
    - Org prompts for coding agents.
    - MCP servers to use.
- Supports **tiers**:
    - Prototype / internal / production.
- CLI supports:
    - `check` – verify config + run linters.
    - Generate linter configs.
    - Audit existing linters.
    - Pull shared prompts into project.

**Usage expectations**

- New projects use the **org CMC config** from day one.
- Old projects gradually migrated to CMC where it makes sense.

---

### 7.2 Context 7 (MCP server)

> 📚 Purpose: keep libraries and SDK usage up-to-date and less hallucination-prone.
> 
- Remote MCP server providing:
    - Latest documentation & examples for many libraries.
- Recommended usage:
    - Install & configure Context 7.
    - Explicitly tell agents:
        - “Use Context 7 to validate any assumptions about this library.”
- Caveats:
    - May sometimes fetch **old package names**.
    - Always pair with tests and sanity checks.

---

### 7.3 Finchly

> 🧱 Purpose: knowledge backbone & MCP discovery.
> 
- Features:
    - **MCP leaderboard** – what tools our team actually uses and likes.
    - **Custom forms / rotating questions** – Slack pings for weekly reflections, feeding into docs.
    - **Doc generation** – can turn transcripts (like this workshop) into posts/wiki entries.

**How we use it**

- Discover & standardise on good MCP servers.
- Capture weekly “what I learned about AI coding”.
- Generate internal docs from expert brain dumps (e.g. Luan’s architecture checklist).

---

### 7.4 Other tools

- **GitHub CLI** – preferred over GitHub MCP integration for many tasks.
- **Doppler** – secrets management; use `doppler run` for local dev.
- **CodeRabbit / GitHub PR review** – AI review; use where it helps, not blindly.

---

## 8. AI Usage Patterns & Pro Tips

### 8.1 Priming > zero-shot

- Don’t open with the “hot word” (controversial topics, tricky library name, etc).
- Build context first:
    - Discuss concepts, patterns, existing methods.
    - Only then introduce the specific problem.

### 8.2 Roundtables & multi-model checks

- “Roundtable” pattern:
    - Ask the model to simulate several experts discussing your problem.
- Multi-model pattern:
    - Give the same prompt to Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.
    - Compare outputs; identify overlaps and disagreements.

### 8.3 Orchestration ideas

- Long-term goal:
    - Orchestrator that:
        - Receives a problem.
        - Fan-outs to multiple agents.
        - Aggregates responses.
- Short-term workaround:
    - Use multiple terminals/tabs with Claude Code and copy/paste between them.

### 8.4 Managing context

- When things feel “off”:
    - Export relevant notes/docs.
    - Clean them manually.
    - Start a fresh session with only what you want present.
- Don’t be afraid to abandon polluted sessions.

### 8.5 Discovering missing tools

- Ask the agent:
    - “What CLI tools would an effective dev in my stack usually have installed that you don’t see here?”
- Install what makes sense (AWS CLI, jq, etc.) to empower the agent and yourself.

## 9. Security & Secrets

### 9.1 Threat model basics

- Assume:
    - Anything on your machine could be read by an agent.
    - Anything sent to a remote AI can be logged or used in training (unless contractually guaranteed otherwise).

### 9.2 Keys & secrets

- Prefer:
    - **SSO sessions** for cloud access.
    - Short-lived, **least-privilege** API keys where necessary.
- Avoid:
    - Storing admin-level keys in reachable files.
    - Committing secrets to repos (even private).

### 9.3 Secrets management tools

- Use **Doppler** (or equivalent):
    - `doppler run` wraps commands with necessary env vars at runtime.
    - Agents don’t see secrets unless they explicitly run the command.

### 9.4 Limiting agent capabilities

- Configure AI tools (e.g. Claude Code) to:
    - Block dangerous commands at **system level**:
        - Repo deletion.
        - Dangerous Docker operations.
        - `rm -rf` type commands.
    - Restrict which directories they can roam in where supported.

### 9.5 Powerful MCP servers

- Treat Docker MCP and similar as **high risk**:
    - Access to Docker can ≈ access to host.
- Only enable after:
    - Clear threat model.
    - Extra safeguards in place.

## 10. Rituals & Processes

### 10.1 AI Coding Workshops

- **Cadence:** e.g. monthly or bi-weekly.
- **Format:**
    - Demo of a tool or workflow (e.g. CMC, Context 7 use cases).
    - Sharing architecture patterns & gotchas.
    - Group Q&A.

### 10.2 Weekly Learning Capture (Finchley)

- **Setup idea:**
    - Every Friday, Slack ping from Finchley asking:
        - “What did you learn about AI coding this week?”
        - “Any new risks or gotchas?”
        - “Any tools or tricks worth sharing?”
    - Answers go into a central Notion/Finchley page.
- Use this as a pipeline for:
    - Updating this playbook.
    - Writing internal blog posts.

### 10.3 Maintaining this page

- **Owner:** *(fill in)*
- **Update frequency:** adjust after each major workshop or when practices change.
- When something proves useful more than once:
    - Add it here.
    - Or spin it out into a dedicated subpage (e.g. “Testing Patterns” or “Security Playbook”).

        - Testing & coverage.
        - Observability.
        - AI tooling & MCPs.
        - Security.
- What are our **official default stacks**?
    - Python services → FastAPI?
    - Frontend frameworks & state management?
    - Default test frameworks?
- How far do we push **multi-agent orchestration**?
    - When is it actually better than one strong agent with good prompts?
